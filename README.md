# notebooklm-source-plus
Chrome extension that adds a folder-style list view to the NotebookLM Sources panel. Create groups and subgroups, move sources by drag and drop, and enable or disable at group or item level. Every toggle mirrors to the real NotebookLM checkboxes so the underlying app state stays in sync. State is saved locally per notebook.
